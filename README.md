SMS (Short Message Service) is a text messaging service component that has become one of the most important communication modes. Spam is the abuse of electronic messaging systems which are sent to the users without their prior permission. SMS Spam is very similar to email spam and can have limited number of characters which can include alphabets, numbers and a few symbols. A spam message classification is a step towards building a tool for scam message identification and early scam detection.

The main objective of here is to try and predict whether a given message is spam or not by using classification algorithms. The SMS Spam dataset used for this classification project was obtained from UCI Machine learning repository. 

The dataset comprises of 5572 text messages and 5 columns:

v1: containing the categorical data of either spam or ham

v2: containing the actual text messages

and three extra Unnamed columns which is redundant.
